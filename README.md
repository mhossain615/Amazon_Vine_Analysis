# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## OVERVIEW

We were working with jenifer and have created a successful project, now for our next project we are analyzing amazon reviews that were written by members of the amazon vine program. We learned that the amazon vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. For our dataset we have chosen gaming review and now are tasked with figuring out if the vine status contributes to helping reviews or not.

### Results 

From our results we concluded that there were about 1785997 reviews and in total 4291 were vine users and and about 1781706 were not vine users (which is a big amount!). from the reviews about 1607 where 5 star reviews while 1025317 were 5 star un paid reviews. lastly percent wise 99% are non vine reviews while only 1 percent are vine reviews.

### Conclusion

In hindsight there are a way bigger amount of non vine reviewer compared to vine reviewers. so it does look like it is not that useful. we would need to add in more data from vine reviewers to get a better analysis on this
